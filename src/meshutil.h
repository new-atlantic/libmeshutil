 * @brief Macro to prevent assigning error values to a NULL pointer.
 * 
 * Most functions in libmeshutil accept an int *error function argument.
 * These functions accept also NULL, in which case the error value is ignored.
 * MU_SET_ERROR is used in the meshutil library to avoid assigning to th
 * NULL pointer. It is not meant to be used by client applications.
