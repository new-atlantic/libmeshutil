/** @page pg_error error function argument
 *
 * error:
 *
 * The int *const error function parameter allows the caller of a meshutil
 * function to get information in case of an error. Often the return value of
 * a function in meshutil does not unambiguously indicate whether an error
 * occurred (e.g. boolean functions returning false) and in these cases it is
 * necessary to check the value of *error to see if an error occurred.
 *
 * Functions requiring the error argument can be passed NULL instead of an
 * integer pointer if the caller does not need to know if an error occurred.
 * This could be the case when it does not make a difference whether e.g. false
 * was returned legitimately or due to an error.

 * @param [in,out] *eptr Pointer to the integer to hold the error value.
 * @param [in]      eval The error value to assign to eptr.
 * 
 * Most functions in libmeshutil accept an int *const error function argument.
 * These functions accept also NULL, in which case the error value is ignored.
 * MU_SET_ERROR is used in the meshutil library to avoid assigning to the
 * NULL pointer. It is not meant to be used by client applications.
