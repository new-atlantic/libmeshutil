/** @page pg_batman_adv_api   API for B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced
 *
 * B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced is a mesh routing protocol over Layer 2 of the network
 * stack. It is implemented as a Linux kernel module.
 *
 * Abbreviations used:
 *
 * * batman_adv, badv:  **B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced**
 * * hwaddr:            **MAC address of network interface**
 * * if:                **network interface**
 * * kmod:              **kernel module**
 * * mac_addr:          **MAC address**
 * * mu_:               **meshutil API prefix**
 *
 * interface_name
 *
 * Functions having the const char *const interface_name function parameter can
 * also be passed NULL in which case the default interface (bat0) is assumed.
 *
 * potential
 *
 * If potential is passed as true the function will count potential next hops
 * as next hops. Potential next hops are nodes which might be the first hop on
 * the way to reach another node (including the potential next hop itself), but
 * which at that moment are not being used for reasons determined by the routing
 * protocol.
